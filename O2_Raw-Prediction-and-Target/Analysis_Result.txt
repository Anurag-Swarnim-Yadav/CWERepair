CWE89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

Result: (1/5)

1) In most of the cases the curl_easy_unescape() that decodes the url from the user was updated using "Curl_urldecode" that
seemed to be a human created function to decode the URL.
The model got confused and in most of the cases it changed it to curl_easy_escape that encodes the URL.
So that it neutralize the special elements.  
In other case it uses depricated sql  mysql_real_escape_string().


Buggyline vs without buggyline
The chances of fixing the vulnerability in this case is better with without buggyline instead of buggyline. 
Buggyline is useful when if we want to correct a bug within the suspicious line.

CWE22-212

Detection: Yes
Prediction Behavior:
Did the model detected the correct variable to work on: Yes 
Did it fix it? No

Expectation:
We expect the model to delete the full function and add new function that will filter out the file path
Traversal. 


Dataset Problem: The marked several lines as <Buggyline> but in reality we need the full function to be
Replaced with new function. This will confuse the model.


With Buggyline and without buggline:
Function it uses and we can expect:
real_path() comparing the absolute path but never checks for the return value of the realpath
strstr(_,_)  for finding substring
strncmp() this function basically compares to two string upto the length to the main string and if they don't
Match it will return NULL.


Behavior: It never produced the required result but did made the program more robust in few examples.

CWE22-512

Detection: Yes
Prediction Behavior:
Did the model detected the correct variable to work on: Yes 
Did it fix it? 

Expectation:
We expect the mode to work on the page variable as it directly uses it in file operations 
like access, file_read, file_write, and unlink.

Dataset Problem: No! It is marked correctly but in the original Target function. The developer has implemented a 
Custom function to filter out CWE-22 vulnerabilities. 


With Buggyline and without buggline:
Function it uses and we can expect:
real_path()
The code does not check the return value of realpath()


Behavior:

CWE77-1608


SUMMARY:

Vulnerable code: 

The run_cmd is called with an additional NULL parameter: run_cmd(tty_fd, xfr_cmd, fname, NULL).



Target code: 

The run_cmd function is called with three parameters: run_cmd(tty_fd, xfr_cmd, fname).



TAKE AWAY: The run_cmd function seems to be a custom function designed to execute a command. The specifics of run_cmd depend on its implementation, which isn't provided in the snippets.

Possible Behaviour: It is called with parameters tty_fd, xfr_cmd, and fname, suggesting that it executes a command (xfr_cmd) related to a terminal or serial port (tty_fd) and involves a filename (fname).

CWE-285-1500

SUMMARY:

The vulnerable code: 

If the type is ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the function performs the followng processing:

1) It calls posix_acl_equiv_mode to check if the ACL can be fully represented by the traditional file mode permission bits. 
2) If posix_acl_equiv_mode returns 0, the acl is set to NULL.
3) if posix_acl_equiv_mode returns value less than 0. It returns posix_acl_equiv_mode value.


Target Code:

1) This version replaces posix_acl_equiv_mode and manual ACL nullification with posix_acl_update_mode, which might handle the ACL more comprehensively.
2) The direct manipulation of mode and acl in vulnerable code is replaced with a call to posix_acl_update_mode. The call is not present and Hence can be determined about the functionality. 



Takeaway: Cant be used for zero-shot.

CWE-285-128

SUMMARY:

The vulnerable code: 

If the ACL type is ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the function performs the followng processing:

1) It calls posix_acl_equiv_mode to check if the ACL can be fully represented by the traditional file mode permission bits. 
2) This function might modify the mode bits of the inode.
3) If posix_acl_equiv_mode returns a non-positive value, it sets acl to NULL. 
4) If the return value is negative, it indicates an error, and the function returns this error.
5) It then calls xfs_set_mode to update the inode's mode based on the new mode bits.



Target Code:

1) This version replaces posix_acl_equiv_mode and manual ACL nullification with posix_acl_update_mode, which might handle the ACL more comprehensively.
2) The direct manipulation of mode and acl in vulnerable code is replaced with a call to posix_acl_update_mode. The call is not present and Hence can be determined about the functionality. 



Takeaway: Cant be used for zero-shot.

CWE369-407


SUMMARY: 

The key difference between the two implementations is the introduction of a new check in TARGET CODE for potential division by zero and undefined behavior related to bit shifting.

 TRAGET CODE introduces additional checks before the main processing loop to prevent potential division by zero or undefined behavior due to bit shifting operations. This check ensures that rpx and rpy values do not cause overflow when shifted, which could result in undefined behavior. The condition also verifies that left-shifting followed by right-shifting comp->dx and comp->dy by rpx and rpy respectively, results in the original values, ensuring that no overflow occurs.

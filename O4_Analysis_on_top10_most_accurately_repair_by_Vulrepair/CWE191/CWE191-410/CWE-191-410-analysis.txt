CWE-191-410

SUMMARY:

The target code dd a check to ensure that urb->actual_length is greater than zero before processing the LSR even. The additional check if (urb->actual_length > 0 && edge_port->lsr_event) before processing the LSR event is an improvement. It ensures that there is data to process, which can help prevent CWE191.

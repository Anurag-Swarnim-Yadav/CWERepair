CWE388-1702


SUMMARY: The function uses a goto fail pattern for error handling. The effectiveness of this pattern depends on whether all potential error paths and resources are correctly accounted for.

The vulnerable code does not specify an error code when an overflow is detected in the calculations of offsets and sizes. The target code sets ret = -EINVAL when it detects an overflow in the calculations. This provides a more specific error code (EINVAL indicates an invalid argument) than just logging the error.

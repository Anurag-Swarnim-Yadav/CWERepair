CWE667-1597


Summary: 

1) Additional Validity Check in Target Code:

Target Code introduces an additional check after acquiring the write lock on mm->mmap_sem with down_write(&mm->mmap_sem);. This check is if (!mmget_still_valid(mm)) goto out_unlock;, which verifies the continued validity of the mm_struct after obtaining the lock. This is a safeguard to ensure that the memory descriptor (mm) is still valid.

2) Memory Management and Safety:

The inclusion of mmget_still_valid in Target Code improves the safety and robustness of the function. It helps to prevent potential race conditions or use-after-free errors where the memory descriptor might become invalid between the time of the initial check and the acquisition of the lock.

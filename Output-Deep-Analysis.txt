CWE-79		Cross-site Scripting

SAMPLE: CWE79-856	

WITHOUT BUGGYLINE:
1) Uses a random function simialr to fucntion definiation to escape the string as a fix. Sample:2,12
2) Will remove the cross-site scripting message as a fix or change the message. 
3)  Will encode the url sample: 15

WITH BUGGYLINE:
1) Move the <endbug> to consider the full if statment as fix. Sample 7 and more (Main behaviour)
2) Generally adds special character filtering as a fix. Sample 10
3) Remove the tags. sample 35
4)Bascially it will try to sanitize or escape user input if this SWE is given. sample 39
5)The closet we got was sample 51



CWE-78		OS Command Injection

SAMPLE: CWE78-1149	

WITHOUT BUGGYLINE AND WITH BUGGYLINE:
1) Tries to Escape characters or sanitized uer input are properly escaped to prevent CWE-78. Sample 17, 19, 36, 48
2)If the tags are not present. It will add the tags if not present.



SAMPLE: CWE78-1502 
[THIS SAMPLE NEEDS ADDITION. THERE IS NOT BUGGYLINE (THE BUGGYLINE PROVIDED IS NOT A BUGGYLINE)]

WITHOUT BUGGYLINE:
1) Addition of the few more cases. Sample 2
2) It does understand that it needs to add new cases. Sample 9,12,18,25,26,34,38,49,50

WITH BUGGYLINE:
1) Can create vulnerability. Sample 4
2) Converts case into if condition but does not fix the problem.
3) Check sample 10, 11, 16, 22,31 (Think about it)
4)The close we get to the sample is 25, 36

Takeaway: The model undertands it needs to add special cases (specially for buggyline). It just dont think "=" is considered as a escape characters or invalid characters.




CWE-89		SQL Injection

SAMPLE: CWE89-57

WITHOUT BUGGYLINE:
1) Mostly the vulnerability was fixed by replacing curl_easy_unescape() with curl_easy_escape() in the code. Sample 2,5,10,12,13,15,16 (can be used for slides; It ends with text that it fixed), 17, 33,46(SAME comments)
2) Sanitzing the user input ie checking for special character. Sample 7,22 

WITH BUGGYLINE:
1) Same behaviour as we saw in without buggyline case. Sample 8,10
2) Adds url_easy_escape first to encode the path and then pass the encoded path to url_easy_unescape(). Sample 9, 13, 17, 23, 25 (Can be used for the slide), 28, 34, 35,40
3) when applying curl_easy_escape(). It removed the & len argument. Sample 16




SAMPLE: CWE89-1063

WITHOUT BUGGYLINE:
1) Adds curl_easy_escape() before curl_easy_unescape(). Sample 18, 22,29,32
2) adding a loop to filter out any potential characters that could be used in an SQL injection attack. The loop checks if any of these characters are present in the path and if they are present, it replaces them with a null character.
After the loop has finished, the path is then passed to curl_easy_unescape. Sample 3, 6, 11
3) Adds my_sql_escape() function to escape teh special characters. Sample 49



WITH BUGGYLINE:
1) Replace the curl_easy_unescape() with curl_easy_escape(). Sample 2, 24,
2) Adds a new for loop to check for the special characters. Sample 4
3) Remove illegal characters from mailbox string to prevent SQL Injection. Sample 5
4) Adds curl_easy_escape() before curl_easy_unescape(). Sample 6, 42, 50
